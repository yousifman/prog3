# prog3

Welcome to Alex and Yousif's program 3!!!

The controls for the program are complicated and are included in the original description.

Importantly however, pressing '!' will toggle between the triangles, ellipsoids, and Kirby!

We completed the following extra credit:
 - Ellipsoids (3 points)
 - Smooth shading by interpolating normals (1 point)
